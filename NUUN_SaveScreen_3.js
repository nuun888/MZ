 * You can customize the save screen.
 * 
 * "Save main window settings" is a window that displays a list of save files.
 * "Save status window settings" is a window that displays the currently selected save information. Multiple windows can be created.
 * 
 * Actor display
 * Actor images can display character chips, face graphics, and side view actors. If a specified member is set in "PartyActorMode", only the specified actor will be displayed.
 * 
 * Also, actor name, occupation, nickname, and level can be displayed for each character in the same way as the actor image. If a specified member is set in "PartyActorMode", only the specified actor will be displayed.
 * 
 * If you want to display different content for the same item, enter any string in the method name. (Character chip, face graphic, side view actor, actor name, level)
 * 
 * Original param
 * To set original items, enter any string in the "Method name".
 * actor:$gameActors (Actor specified by "SpecifyActor" (leader if not specified))
 * 
 * Actor original params
 * To set original items, enter any string in the "Method name".
 * It can be displayed for each character in the same way as actor images.
 * 
 * actor:$gameActors
 * 
 * ShowEval
 * actor:$gameActors (Actor specified by "SpecifyActor" (leader if not specified))
 * The only variables that can be referenced in the free text display conditions are info information, file name numbers, and display window objects.
 * 
 * The drawTextEx display does not apply the font size of the plugin parameter.
 * Set the text with \FS[x].
 * 
 * Change background image
 * You can change the background image as the game progresses.
 * By default, the background ID will be changed each time you change it with the plug-in command "Change background image".
 * The background ID of the save data with the highest ID is displayed on the loading screen.
 * 
 * Autosave snapshot
 * When autosaving, snapshots will be taken of the map just before the start of the battle and the map just before moving.
 * 
 * Content background setting (NUUN_Base ver.1.6.2 or later)
 * You can set an image as the content background for each save.
 * Usually, the background of list number 1 is displayed.
 * Use the second and later when you want to change the content background for each map.
 * Specify the file directly to change with the plug-in command.
 * 
 * The origin position of the content background image and the enlargement rate are set by the plug-in parameter "Content background image setting".
 * When an image with the same name as the image set in the content background is displayed, the set origin and magnification are applied.
 * If not set, it will be applied with the origin 0,0 and the magnification rate 100%.
 * 
 * Map Notes
 * <SaveContentsBackImg:[filename]> Specifies the content background image. For maps with this tag set, the image set in the map is applied instead of the image set in the plug-in parameter and plug-in command.
 * [filename]:list number of content background image

 * セーブ画面をカスタマイズできます。
 * 
 * セーブメインウィンドウはセーブファイルのリストを表示するウィンドウです。
 * セーブステータスウィンドウは選択中のセーブ情報を表示するウィンドウです。このウィンドウは複数生成できます。
 * 
 * アクターの表示
 * アクター画像はキャラチップ、顔グラフィック、サイドビューアクターを表示できます。PartyActorModeで指定のメンバーを設定している場合は
 * 指定アクターのみ表示されます。
 * 
 * また、アクター名、職業、ニックネーム、レベルはアクター画像と同様にキャラ毎に表示可能です。PartyActorModeで指定のメンバーを設定している場合は
 * 指定アクターのみ表示されます。
 * 
 * 同じ項目で別の内容を表示させる場合はメソッド名に任意の文字列を記入します。(キャラチップ、顔グラフィック、サイドビューアクター、アクター名、レベル)
 * 
 * オリジナル項目
 * オリジナル項目を設定するにはメソッド名に任意の文字列を記入してください。
 * actor:$gameActors (指定のアクター変更で指定したアクター(指定してない場合はリーダー))
 * 
 * アクターオリジナルパラメータ
 * オリジナルパラメータを設定するにはメソッド名に任意の文字列を記入してください。
 * アクター画像と同様にキャラ毎に表示可能です。PartyActorModeで指定のメンバーを設定している場合は
 * 指定アクターのみ表示されます。
 * actor:$gameActors
 * 
 * 表示条件
 * actor:$gameActors (指定のアクター変更で指定したアクター(指定してない場合はリーダー))
 * フリーテキストの表示条件で参照できる変数はインフォ情報とファイル名番号及び表示ウィンドウのオブジェクトのみになります。
 * 
 * drawTextEx表示はプラグインパラメータのフォントサイズが適用されません。
 * テキストに\FS[x]で設定してください。
 * 
 * 背景画像の変更
 * ゲームの進行によって背景画像を変更出来ます。
 * 初期設定ではプラグインコマンド「背景画像変更」で変更したたびに背景IDが変更されます。
 * 背景IDはロード画面でIDの一番高いセーブデータの背景が表示されます。
 * 
 * オートセーブ時のスナップショット
 * オートセーブ時のスナップショットは戦闘開始直前のマップ、移動直前のマップが撮影されます。
 * 
 * スナップショットを表示するとセーブ容量が大きります。
 * 
 * コンテンツ背景の設定
 * 各セーブのコンテンツ背景に画像を設定できます。
 * 通常はリスト番号1番の背景が表示されます。
 * 2番以降はマップ毎でコンテンツ背景を変更したい場合に使用します。
 * プラグインコマンドでの変更は直接ファイルを指定します。
 * 
 * コンテンツ背景の画像の原点位置及び、拡大率はプラグインパラメータのコンテンツ背景画像設定で行います。
 * コンテンツ背景に設定された画像を同じ名前の画像が表示されるとき、設定された原点、拡大率が適用されます。
 * 設定されていない場合は原点0,0、拡大率100%で適用されます。
 * 
 * マップの設定のメモ欄
 * <SaveContentsBackImg:[filename]> コンテンツ背景の画像を指定します。このタグが設定されているマップは、プラグインパラメータ及びプラグインコマンドで
 * 設定された画像は適用されずマップに設定された画像が適用されます。
 * [filename]:コンテンツ背景画像のリスト番号
 * 
 * 利用規約
 * このプラグインはMITライセンスで配布しています。
 * 
 * 更新履歴
 * 2024/5/5 Ver.3.0.2
 * アクターオリジナルパラメータが表示されない問題を修正。
 * プラグインコマンドが実行できない問題を修正。
 * 単位を追加。
 * 2024/5/4 Ver.3.0.1
 * パラメータが取得されない問題を修正。
